/*@
Elaborate the composition of code blocks of a class - the last step of preprocessing.
During this phase we inspect the contents of method bodies, instance initializers and
static initializers of a class and perform the following transformations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item each variable name x is resolved into either:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item x - a local var
    \item Class.x - a static var defined in the class Class
    \item field(obj, Class, x) - a field of object obj declared in the class Class.
      Term obj could also be 'This.
  \end{itemize}
  \item each method name is resolved into either:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Class.m - a static method defined in the class Class
    \item method(obj, Class, x) - an instance method of object obj declared in the class Class.
      Term obj could also be 'This. The actual version of the method will be looked up at runtime.
  \end{itemize}
  \item each method signature is resolved into its appropriate overloaded version. To
    denote the version, each actual parameter will be casted to the type of the actual parameter.
  \item each expression Exp will be replaced with a corresponding typed expression cast(T, Exp),
    T being the compile-time type of the expression.
\end{itemize}

    /smallskip
    During elaboration, elaborated members will be wrapped into elab().

    During elaboration an expression transition through 6 phases:
  1. Elaboration heating:
      elab('CastRef(\_,, 'Minus('ExprName(x))))
      => elab('Minus('ExprName(x)) ~> elab('CastRef(\_,, HOLE)
    Some AST terms, especially some statements require custom elaboration heating rules. If the heated expression
      should be always computed into a KResult, such as a type, package or certain literal expresssions, then
      it is heated in the "naked" form, e.g. not wrapped into elab().
  2. Elaboration of children. All the children of the expression are elaborated. After this phase elaborated children
    will be typed (if they are expressions) and wrapped into elabRes(). Typed expressions are cast expressions -
    like cast(T, Exp). The whole initial term will be converted into:
      elab('Minus(elabRes(cast(int, localVar(X))))) ~> elab('CastRef(\_,, HOLE)
  3. Initiation of the step elabDispose. When all children have been elaborated and are either KResult of elabRes(),
    the wrapper is changed from elab() to elabDispose().
      elabDispose('Minus(elabRes(cast(int, localVar(X))))) ~> elab('CastRef(\_,, HOLE)
  4. Unwrapping of children. During elabDispose step elaborated children are unwrapped from their elabRes() wrapper.
      elabDispose('Minus(cast(int, localVar(X)))) ~> elab('CastRef(\_,, HOLE)
  5. End of the step elabDispose. When all children of the term wrapped into elabDispose have been unwrapped
    from their elabRes() wrapper, the root wrapper is replaced from elabDispose to elabEnd. This contributes
    to more simple rules for the following steps.
    elabRes('Minus(cast(int, localVar(X)))) ~> elab('CastRef(\_,, HOLE)
  6. Computation of elaboration result. Now that all children have been elaborated and unwrapped, it is possible to
    compute the type of the current expression itself. When the expression is fully elaborated, it is wrapped into
    elabRes(). This is the step that requires custom rules for most AST terms.
      elabRes('Minus(cast(int,cast(int, localVar(X))))) ~> elab('CastRef(\_,, HOLE)
      elabRes(cast(int, 'Minus(cast(int, localVar(X))))) ~> elab('CastRef(\_,, HOLE) <- shouldn't it be like this?
  7. Elaboration cooling. Once the top K Item was wrapped into elabRes, it is ready to be cooled back into its original
    context:
      elab('CastRef(\_,, elabRes('Minus(cast(int,cast(int, localVar(X)))))))
